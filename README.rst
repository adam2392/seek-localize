This repo helps localize iEEG electrodes on CT images.

For ECoG data, we do not explicitly have a process outlined, but these are significantly easier since grids can
be easily interpolated. See `Fieldtrip Toolbox`_.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

See `INSTALLATION GUIDE <https://github.com/adam2392/seek_localize/blob/master/doc/installation.rst>`_ for full instructions.
A quick setup can occur with ``pipenv``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # clone repository locally
    $ git clone https://github.com/adam2392/seek_localize
    $ python3.8 -m venv .venv
    $ pipenv install


Data Organization
-----------------

We use BIDS. See https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/The-BIDS-folder-hierarchy
for more information. We recommend the following BIDS structure with the minimally required set of files.

.. code-block::

   {bids_root}/
        /sub-001/
            /anat/
                - sub-001_*_T1w.nii
            /ct/
                - sub-001_*_CT.nii
            /ieeg/
                - sub-001_*_channels.tsv
                - sub-001_*_electrodes.tsv
                - *
